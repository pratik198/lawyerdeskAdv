                1. Was the dog on a leash or under the control of the owner at
                the time of the incident?
              </p>
              <p>Reason:</p>
              <p>
                This question aims to establish whether the owner was negligent
                in controlling the dog, which is crucial for proving liability.
              </p>

            <div className="question">
              <p>
                2. Did the dog show any signs of aggression or previous violent
                behavior before the incident?
              </p>
              <p>Reason:</p>
              <p>
                This question is important to demonstrate the owner's knowledge
                of the dog's aggressive tendencies, which can support the claim
                of negligence.
              </p>

            <div className="question">

                3. Were there any warning signs or notices indicating the
                presence of a dangerous dog on the owner's property?
              </p>
              <p>Reason:</p>
              <p>
                This question seeks to determine if the owner took reasonable
                precautions to warn others about the potential danger posed by
                the dog.

            <div className="question">

                4. Has the dog been involved in similar incidents of biting or
                aggression in the past?
              </p>
              <p>Reason:</p>
              <p>
                This question is relevant to establish a pattern of behavior and
                the owner's awareness of the dog's propensity for aggression.

            <div className="question">
              <p>
                5. Did the owner take immediate steps to assist or provide
                medical aid to the victim after the dog bite incident?
              </p>
              <p>Reason:</p>
              <p>
                This question addresses the owner's duty of care and
                responsibility towards the victim following the incident.

                6. Can you provide any evidence of communication or interaction
                with the owner regarding the dog's behavior prior to the
                incident?
